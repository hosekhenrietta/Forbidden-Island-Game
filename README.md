# Forbidden-Island-Game

Order of Play
The player who last visited an island goes first and play continues to the
left. On every turn, do the following three things in order:
1. Take up to 3 actions.
2. Draw 2 Treasure deck cards.
3. Draw Flood cards equal to the water level.
The parts of each turn are described below. Also note that the back of
every Adventurer card shows a quick reference guide.

1. Take Up to 3 Actions
You may take up to 3 actions each turn (could be 0, 1, or 2). Your teammates are allowed
(and encouraged!) to give you advice on the best actions to take during your turn. Select a
combination of any of the following 4 actions:
• Move
• Shore Up
• Give a Treasure Card
• Capture a Treasure
Move
You may, for 1 or more actions, move your pawn to an adjacent Island
tile: either up, down, left, or right, but never diagonally. You may
move onto a flooded tile, but may not move onto (or over) the space of
a missing tile.
Exceptions:
 The Explorer may also move diagonally.

The Pilot may move to any tile once per turn for 1 action.
 The Navigator may move other players up to 2 adjacent tiles per action.
 The Diver may move through one or more adjacent missing and/or
 flooded tiles for 1 action.
Shore Up
You may, for 1 or more actions, shore up any adjacent Island tile
(up, down, left, right), or the Island tile your pawn is on. To shore
up a tile, simply flip it over so its un-flooded side is facing up.
Exceptions:
 The Engineer may shore up 2 tiles for 1 action.
 The Explorer may also shore up tiles diagonally.

Give a Treasure Card
You may give 1 or more of your Treasure cards to
another player if both of your pawns are on the same
island tile. It costs 1 action for each card you give away.
(See “Hand Limit” for restrictions.) You may not give
Special Action cards.
Exceptions:
 The Messenger may give cards without having to be on the same tile.
